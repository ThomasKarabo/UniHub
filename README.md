# UniHub

UniHub is a centralized digital platform designed to streamline and enhance the university experience for students, staff, and administrators. This project aims to create a one-stop hub where all academic, administrative, and social resources are easily accessible, improving communication, efficiency, and engagement within the university community.

## Project Overview

**UniHub** addresses the fragmented nature of university digital services by bringing together various functions—such as course management, event scheduling, resource booking, communication tools, and more—into a single, user-friendly interface. The platform is envisioned to support integration with existing university systems, offer role-specific dashboards, and provide tools to foster collaboration and campus life.
